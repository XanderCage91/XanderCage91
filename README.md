Hello, my name is Alexandru, I'm 32 years old and I currently live in Rome, Italy. At the moment I work as a seller in a bakery shop, but I really like computers, IT has become my passion and I want to learn how to code and eventually work in this sector one day
I'm studying Full STack Development following IBM's course on Coursera and in parallel I study by my own following tutorials, reading pdfs etc. I want to learn how to create websites, but actually I'm more interested in the technicall part
of the development process, backend skills. Javascript, python, git, vs code, are all programs that I like very much and I'm studying them every night.
Once I get my certificate on coursera and create my own portfolio, I will search for jobs in my country, even if working with companies from around the world would be interesting.
